Welcome to post number one of my personal site. As detailed over on my about section, I like to write literary fiction and sometimes poetry and sometimes "nonfiction." Nonfiction doesn't really cover any essays or vague complainings I would upload here but for lack of a better term it stays. I also program; that all, however, shall be housed exclusively on my Github. I will likely post explaining my process behind anything I upload there, however.

I have no schedule for posts as of right now. I trust this will keep anyone reading in suspense.
