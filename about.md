[Check out my resume.](../Resume.pdf)

Hey there. Ryan here. Honors sophomore CS student at the University of Maryland, College Park. I program primarily in Java and C, though I have working knowledge of some HTML and CSS and mess around with Javascript and Python every now and then.

I also--as you will probably see elsewhere on this site--write creatively and substantively depending on my mood. My fiction focuses on "coming of age" (emphasis on the quotes) stories wrapped in some layer of irony and/or weird. My poetry (should I ever upload any) focuses on the weird. Any non-creative works will almost surely be political or silly observations or generalized complaining.

When I'm not programming or writing, I'm halfway decent at Smash 4. There's a chance of me beating you as Villager/Cloud/Mario. No promises.
